var lotsOfText = "Steve Rogers was a scrawny fine arts student growing up during the Great Depression. His alcoholic father died when Steve was a child, and his mother passed away from pneumonia after he graduated high school. In early 1940, appalled at Nazi Germany’s horrific atrocities, Steve attempted to enlist in the army. Failing to pass physical requirements, he was invited to volunteer for Operation: Rebirth, a project intended to enhance US soldiers to the height of physical perfection via the inventions and discoveries of Professor Abraham Erskine. Rogers eagerly accepted and became the first test subject. After injections and ingestion of the 'Super Soldier Serum,' Rogers was exposed to a controlled burst of 'Vita - Rays' that activated and stabilized the chemicals in his system. The process successfully altered his physiology from its frail state to the maximum of human efficiency, including greatly enhanced musculature and reflexes. Soon after, Professor Erskine was assassinated by a Nazi operative, leaving Steve the sole beneficiary of Erskine’s genius. Renamed “Project: Rebirth,” variations of the Super-Soldier serum were subsequently tested, under inhuman conditions, on African-American soldiers. The most successful of these was Isaiah Bradley, and Project: Rebirth’s resources were eventually absorbed into a multinational superhuman research project dubbed Weapon Plus. Rogers was assigned to serve as an who served both as a counter - intelligence agent and a symbolic US hero to counter Nazi Germany 's propaganda successes head by the Red Skull (Johann Shmidt). Wearing a costume based on his own design modeled after the American flag, Steve was given a triangular bulletproof shield, a personal sidearm and the codename Captain America, the Sentinel of Liberty. He was also provided a cover identity as a clumsy infantry private at Camp Lehigh in Virginia. His first opponents included the Red Skull himself and Nazi attempts to duplicate Erskine’s serum with their own super soldiers. During a mission to the African nation of Wakanda, “Cap” befriended the nation’s ruler T’Chaka and obtained a sample of the rare metal Vibranium. Subsequent experiments with this metal produced a uniquely indestructible Vibranium-steel alloy disc, which proved impossible to duplicate. The disc was given to Cap as his new shield. Cap and BuckyBarely out of his teens himself, Rogers made friends with the army’ s camp mascot, teenager James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes.Barnes accidentally learned of Rogers ' dual identity and offered to keep the secret if he could become Captain America's sidekick.Rogers agreed, and trained Barnes.Throughout 1941, Cap and Bucky shared many adventures stateside and throughout the world.When the US entered World War II, Cap and Bucky teamed with the android Human Torch, his mutant sidekick Toro, and Namor the ocean - dwelling Sub - Mariner as the Allied force the Invaders. In the closing days of World War II in early 1945, Cap broke through Nazi troops for his final wartime confrontation with the Red Skull, who was seemingly slain by bombing debris(but lived on in suspended animation).Days later, Cap and Bucky arrived in England too late to prevent brilliant Nazi scientist Baron Zemo from obtaining and launching an experimental drone plane armed explosive device on it.Rogers and Barnes reached the plane, but when Bucky tried to defuse the bomb, it exploded in mid - air.Rogers was hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic.The US government presumed both were dead.However, Bucky was secretly retrieved by Soviet operatives, while Cap was recovered by Nazi agent Lyle Dekker, who hoped to exchange bodies with him.Cap escaped Dekker’ s base by air, but was shot down and fell back into the ocean.Due to the Super - Soldier serum Captain America survived, entering a state of suspended animation and eventually freezing in solid ice. The Awesome Thaw and the Mighty Thor Years later, a team of super - heroes called the Avengers discovered Rogers ' frozen body in the North Atlantic, where he had been preserved since 1945. Once revived, Rogers was devastated by Bucky’s supposed death and the loss of everything once familiar to him. The Avengers were attacked by Namor’s ally, the extraterrestrial Vuk the D’bari, who transformed the heroes into stone. Cap confronted the alien, making him their ally, and helped the restored Avengers defeat Cap’s former teammate from the Invaders, Namor. After that adventure, Captain America was invited to join the Avengers as their first recruit. Cap formed close friendships with his teammates Thor, Iron Man (Tony Stark), Giant-Man (Hank Pym), the Wasp, and the Avengers’ butler Edwin Jarvis. Cap’ s revival, reported worldwide, brought the long - retired Baron Zemo out of seclusion.Enraged that his enemy still lived, Zemo organized several superhuman criminals as the Masters of Evil and set them against the Avengers, the first of many such battles with various incarnations of the Masters.Soon afterward, Cap and the Avengers repelled an invasion by the time - traveling menace Kang the Conqueror, clashed with Kang’ s alternate version of himself from the future, Immortus, and encountered the heroic team of mutants, the X - Men, during an investigation of the extraterrestrial Lucifer.Zemo had his Masters launch a final assault on the Avengers.While the other Avengers defeated the Masters, Cap stormed Zemo’ s South American stronghold, where Zemo accidentally killed himself by triggering an avalanche in battle with Cap. Returning to New York, Cap learned the other Avengers were taking leaves of absence from the team and had already recruited repentant outlaws including the archer Hawkeye(Clint Barton), mutant speedster Quicksilver and his sister the probability - altering Scarlet Witch as their replacements.Unperturbed by the new trio’ s earlier crimes, Cap became fulltime Avengers leader as the only remaining senior member.His leadership helped quell public skepticism about the new roster, nicknamed“ Cap’ s Kooky Quartet.”Cap became a mentor to the trio, assisting Quicksilver and the Witch’ s assimilation in the US and bearing the brunt of Hawkeye’ s youthful rebellion. Hearts and Skulls During Cap’ s early solo adventures and as an Avenger, he persistently protected the world from global threats.In Germany he almost single - handedly saved the world from three monstrous Sleeper robots, created by the Red Skull.Soon afterward, he aided SHIELD agent Sharon Carter in retrieving the explosive“ Inferno 42” stolen from the subversive group Advanced Idea Mechanics(AIM) by Batroc the Leaper, a flamboyant mercenary who came to regard Cap as his favorite adversary.Cap’ s wartime friend Nick Fury, now SHIELD Director, recruited him in further anti - AIM operations and offered him SHIELD membership, which Cap declined, preferring to remain active with the Avengers and as a solo operative.During SHIELD’ s continued conflicts with AIM, Cap learned the enemy organization had discovered and revived the Red Skull, who repaid their hospitality by stealing their near - omnipotent Cosmic Cube.Battling his oldest enemy for the first time since the war, Cap manipulated the Skull’ s ego to force him into physical combat, and then struggled with him for the Cube itself.Lashing out with its power, the Skull caused an earthquake and again vanished beneath rubble.Following his recovery, the Skull lured his enemy into a trap via a robot duplicate of Bucky, but failed to extort Cap into supposed treason via a threat to New York. After several shared adventures, Cap and Sharon fell in love, but when she rejected his marriage proposal, Cap decided to give up crimefighting and revealed his true identity to the public.He soon recanted his decision to retire and returned to action.Cap again clashed with the Red Skull, who had revived the Fourth Sleeper to wreak havoc.With Sharon’ s help, Cap deactivated the robot, and forced the Skull to flee. The Sidekick, the Secret, and the Switch Meanwhile Rick Jones, the young friend of the Hulk, pursued Captain America to become his partner, and Cap allowed the youth to accompany him into battle against the terrorists of Hydra, then led by Madame Hydra.When Hydra later abducted Rick, Cap rescued his new sidekick.During that mission, regretting his decision to make his identity public, Cap made himself appear to be shot down, leaving a realistic Steve Rogers mask to convince the world the Rogers identity had been false to protect his privacy.In addition, Cap and Rick ran afoul of old Avengers foe the shape - changing Space Phantom, who as part of his own plot removed the world’ s knowledge of Cap’ s secret identity. The Red Skull continued to toy with Captain America’ s life, using the Cosmic Cube to switch bodies with the hero.The Skull in Cap’ s body alienated Rick into quitting his sidekick role, while Rogers in the Skull’ s body was sent to Exile Island, where he was attacked(by those thinking he was the Skull) and befriended by adventurer Sam Wilson.Wilson, formerly criminal“ Snap” Wilson, had undergone personality alteration by the Skull, and was planted so as to eventually become Cap’ s partner, setting the stage for a potential future betrayal.As the costumed Falcon, accompanied by his trained bird Redwing, Wilson helped Cap confront the Skull, who returned his foe and himself to their rightful bodies so as to better savor a triumph.Before the Skull could destroy the pair, however, AIM avenged the Skull’ s earlier betrayal by robbing the Cube of its power. The Skull escaped yet again. Street Fights to Space Wars In the adventures that followed, Cap encountered an android replica of Bucky planted by mutated AIM leader MODOK’ s.The android replicated Bucky’ s altruism and sacrificed itself, foiling MODOK’ s schemes.In New York City, Cap and the Falcon became crimefighting partners, as the Red Skull had intended, and found a number of local villains.Beyond pedestrian - level threats, Captain America became involved with cosmic battles.With the Avengers team, and the alien Kree Captain Mar - Vell, Cap intervened in the millennia - old Kree - Skrull War after it threatened Earth. Back home, with Earth safe from the Skrulls, Cap and the Falcon battled gangsters and the Red Skull’ s Fifth Sleeper robot unleashed in Las Vegas.The surrogate Captain America and Bucky(Jack Monroe) of the 1950 s were freed after being driven mad by faulty Super - Soldier treatments and placed in suspended animation for decades.Cap and Falcon defeated the madmen.The Viper(Jordan Dixon), teamed with Eel(Edward Lavell) and Cobra(Klaus Voorhees) to battle Cap and Falcon as the Serpent Squad, and variations on this serpent - themed group would plague Cap repeatedly.Baron Zemo’ s son Helmut surfaced, heir to Heinrich’ s barony, genius, and above all his hatred of Captain America.When Falcon intervened in a grudge match between Hemut and Cap, the younger Zemo seemingly perished in a vat of his father’ s chemical“ Adhesive X.” The Secret Empire and Time - Traveling Turmoil On the home front, Captain America was disheartened to discover the Secret Empire, an underground organization tied to a high - ranking US government official.Cap and other heroes protected the White House against the Empire’ s assault, but Cap was left deeply shaken by the affair.Standing beside past and future versions of the Avengers, Cap battled to save humanity from the Time - Keepers, extraterrestrial beings from the“ End of Time.”He returned from the battle victorious, but with no memories of his journey outside of the bounds of time.After he and the Avengers joined the powerful alien Kree soldier, Captain Mar - Vell, against the cosmic menace Thanos, Cap and Sharon accompanied the rocky hero, the Thing, to 31 st century(a possible future designated Earth - 691).With the heroes known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, they helped battle against the Earth’ s conquerors from the alien Badoon race. Nomad Back in the present day, Rogers felt disillusioned by the corruption of the US government by the Secret Empire, and abandoned his role as Captain America while adopting a new costumed identity as the Nomad.In his new guise, he and Namor confronted Viper, the former Madame Hydra, who had embarked on a campaign of terror as leader of the Serpent Squad.The two heroes prevented Viper and her Atlantean ally Krang from using the ancient and powerful Serpent Crown.Later, the savagery of the Red Skull prompted Steve to reclaim his Captain America identity. A Partner’ s Past Exposed In a subsequent battle, the Red Skull revealed his role in Falcon’ s origin, giving Cap’ s partner his own identity crisis.Despite learning of his partner’ s checkered past, Cap stayed by his side and accompanied Falcon to court, where his partner faced charges for the crimes of his earlier self.Though placed on parole, Falcon was able to continue fighting crime at Cap’ s side. Captain America continued his incredible war against injustice across the globe.He partnered with Captain Britain(Brian Braddock in Great Britain against the Red Skull’ s terrorism against London, prevented the Royalist Forces of America from driving the USA insane with their Madbomb, and formed an uncomfortable alliance with Doom against yet another of the Skull’ s schemes; the Skull was revealed to be bankrolling worldwide chaos caused by the mutated creatures of former Nazi scientist Arnim Zola.During a period Captain America suffered from amnesia of his early memories, a new threat arose with hypnotist Dr.Faustus’ National Force, whose puppet leader, the Grand Director, was actually the 1950 s Captain America Faustus had brainwashed.Sharon Carter infiltrated the Force but was seemingly brainwashed and burned to death.In fact, Sharon faked her death and went under deep cover for SHIELD."
