ENCRYPTION
**********

This is a tool that I've been developing simply for the purpose of becoming more familiar with code. But it seems to work quite well, I've been very pleased with the results. See a live version at drew-killeen.github.io/encryption

TODO
----
1. Fix Autokey Cipher
2. Ensure that when the input forms automatically switch that they don't conflict with each other
3. Continue to develop frequency analysis tools
