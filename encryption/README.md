ENCRYPTION
**********

This is a tool that I've been developing simply for the purpose of becoming more familiar with code. But it seems to work quite well, I've been very pleased with the results. See a live version at drew-killeen.github.io/encryption

TODO
----
1. Fix Autokey Cipher
2. Continue to develop frequency analysis tools
3. Make it so that breakCaesarCipher is able to detect if it should output all keys or only one, rather than making that decision based on the length of the text
4. Send the content of the output textarea from index.html to the input textarea of frequency.html
