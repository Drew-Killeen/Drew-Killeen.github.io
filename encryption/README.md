ENCRYPTION
**********

This is a tool that I've been developing simply for the purpose of becoming more familiar with code. But it seems to work quite well, I've been very pleased with the results. See a live version at drew-killeen.github.io/encryption

TODO
----
1. Fix Autokey Cipher
2. Ensure that when the input forms automatically switch that they don't conflict with each other
3. Continue to develop frequency analysis tools
4. Merge info.html and info-freq.html with their respective pages
5. Make it so that breakCaesarCipher is able to detect if it should output all keys or only one, rather than making that decision based on the length of the text
